# OFDM-GNU-Radio
Implementation of OFDM using GNU Radio

This repository contains an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) system implementation using GNU Radio. The project demonstrates the design and simulation of an OFDM transceiver using GNU Radio Companion (.grc) files, along with output visuals for analysis.

## Repository Contents

- `ofdm_.grc`  
  GNU Radio Companion flowgraph file for the OFDM system setup.

- `output/`  
  Folder containing output images demonstrating results and signals at various stages of the OFDM system:
  - `blocks.jpeg`
  - `output_1.jpeg`
  - `output_2.jpeg`

- `README.md`  
  This file, providing an overview and instructions related to the project.

## Overview

OFDM is a popular multicarrier modulation technique widely used in wireless communication systems due to its robustness against multipath fading and efficient spectrum utilization. This project illustrates an OFDM transceiver chain designed and simulated using GNU Radio tools.

## How to Use

1. Install [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) on your system if not already installed.
2. Open the `ofdm_.grc` file with GNU Radio Companion.
3. Run the flowgraph to simulate the OFDM transmission and reception.
4. Check the `output` folder images to observe the waveform and signal characteristics at different stages.

## Output Samples

- `blocks.jpeg` – Visual representation of baseband signal blocks.
- `output_1.jpeg` – Signal spectrum or constellation at a specific stage.
- `output_2.jpeg` – Further signal processing results.
